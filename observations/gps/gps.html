<H2>Overview</H2>


<P>
GPS Radio Occultation data are being returned from a series of satellites as
part of the <a href="http://www.cosmic.ucar.edu">COSMIC</a> project.  The
programs in this directory extract the data from the distribution files and
put them into DART observation sequence (obs_seq) file format.
</P>
<P>
The COSMIC satellites measure the phase delay caused
by deviation of the
straight-line path of the GPS satellite signal as
it passes through the Earth's atmosphere when the
GPS and COSMIC
satellites rise and set relative to each other.
This deviation results from changes in the angle of refraction of light
as it passes through regions of varying density of atmosphere.
These changes are a result of variations in the temperature,
pressure, and moisture content.
Vertical profiles of temperature and moisture can be derived as 
the signal passes through more and more atmosphere 
until it is obscured by the earth's horizon.
There are thousands of observations each day
distributed around the globe, including in areas which
previously were poorly observed.
</P>

<H2>DATA SOURCES</H2>

<P>
Data from 
<a href="http://www.cosmic.ucar.edu">COSMIC</a> 
is available by signing up on the
<a href="http://cosmic-io.cosmic.ucar.edu/cdaac">data access</a>
web page.
It is delivered in
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf">netCDF</a>
file format.
The files we use as input to these conversion programs are
the Level 2 data, Atmospheric Profiles (filenames include
the string 'atmPrf').
</P>

<P>
Currently each vertical profile is stored in a separate file,
and there are between 1000-3000 profiles/day, so converting a day's
worth of observations involves downloading many individual files.
There are plans in place by the data providers to bundle these 
profiles together in a tar file to make it simpler to download the raw data.
</P>

<P>
The scripts in the <em class=file>shell_scripts</em> directory now
by default try to download profiles from any of the available
satellites that return GPS RO data to the CDAAC web site.  See the
<em class=file>do_convert.csh</em> script for a list of what 
satellites are checked by default.
</P>

<!--==================================================================-->

<A NAME="Programs"></A>
<div class="top">[<a href="#">top</a>]</div><hr />
<H2>PROGRAMS</H2>

<P>
The data are distributed in
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf">netCDF</a>
file format.  DART requires all observations to be in a proprietary
format often called DART "obs_seq" format.
The files in this directory (a combination
of C shell scripts and a Fortran source executable)
do this data conversion.
</P>
<P>
The shell_scripts directory contains several example scripts, including one 
which downloads the raw data files a day at a time (download_script.csh), 
and one which executes the conversion program (convert_script.csh).  
These scripts make 6 hour files by default, but have options for other times.  
Each profile is stored in a separate netcdf file and there are usually
between 1000-3000 files/day, so the download process can be
lengthy.  You probably want to download as a separate preprocess step
and do not use the script options to automatically delete the input files.
Keep the files around until you are sure you are satisified with the
output files and then delete them by hand.
</P>
<P>
The conversion executable <em class=file>convert_cosmic_gps_cdf</em>, 
reads the namelist
<A HREF="#Namelist"> <em class=code>&amp;convert_cosmic_gps_nml</em> </A>
from the file <em class=file>input.nml</em>.
</P>
<P>
The namelist lets you select from one of two different forward
operators.  The 'local' forward operator computes the expected
observation value at a single point: the requested height at the
tangent point of the ray between satellites.  The 'non-local' operator
computes values along the ray-path and does an integration to get
the expected value.  The length of the integration segments and
height at which to end the integration are given in the namelist.
In some experiments the difference between the two types of
operators was negligible.  This choice is made at the time of
the conversion, and the type of operator is stored in the observation,
so at runtime the corresponding forward operator will be used to
compute the expected observation value.
</P>
<P>
The namelist also lets you specify at what heights you want
observations to be extracted.  The raw data is very dense in
the vertical; using all values would not results in a set of
independent observations.  The current source code no longer
does an intermediate interpolation; the original profiles
appear to be smooth enough that this is not needed.  The requested
vertical output heights are interpolated directly from the full profile.
</P>

<H2>KNOWN BUGS</H2>
<P>
Some COSMIC files seem to have internal times which differ from the
times encoded in the filenames by as much as 2-3 minutes.  If it is
important to get all the observations within a particular time window
files with filenames from a few minutes before and after the window 
should be converted.
Times really outside the window can be excluded in a separate step using the
<a href="../../obs_sequence/obs_sequence_tool.html">obs_sequence_tool</a>.

<H2>FUTURE PLANS</H2>
<P>
The current code bins the data into 200 vertical bins as a first step,
and then reinterpolates again onto the requested vertical heights.
The original intent was to smooth out any noise in the dense profiles
before interpolating onto the final heights, but plots have shown that
the original data is smooth and can be used directly.  There are plans
to remove the intermediate binning step.
</P>
