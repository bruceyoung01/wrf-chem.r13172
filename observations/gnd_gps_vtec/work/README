This is just a modification of a standard "text" converter that comes with DART. 

It reads VTEC text files (which I get from OpenMadrigal at http://madrigal.haystack.mit.edu/) and outputs DART obs_seq.out files.

Please check out work/input.nml:&text_to_obs_nml as it specifies the name of the input and the output files

The provided file work/gps021201g.002.txt is only for example (only 2 datapoints are shown) and not for real estimation.
