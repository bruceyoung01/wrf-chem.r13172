This file explains how to compile the NCEP BUFRLIB software, which is
described in detail at http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/sib/decoders/BUFRLIB/,
and whose usage is governed by the terms and conditions of the disclaimer
http://www.nws.noaa.gov/disclaimer.html

The NCEP BUFRLIB software has been compiled and tested across a wide variety
of UNIX platforms, including AIX 4.x and 5.x, HP-UX 9.x and 10.x, IRIX 6.x,
SunOS 5.x and RedHat Linux 5.2; thus, it should port with minimal difficulty
to any UNIX system.  In general, no special compiler flags are required,
and therefore the simple commands:

    $AC -c *.c
    $FC -c *.f

where $AC and $FC point to, respectively, the local ANSI C and FORTRAN 77
compilers, should suffice for most systems.  Nevertheless, there is one
special ANSI C compiler option that is system-dependent and which the user
should therefore be aware of:

    -DUNDERSCORE
	should be added if the system requires that C routines include a
	trailing underscore in order to interface with FORTRAN routines

At any rate, and once compilation has been successfully completed, it is then
recommended to assemble all of the compiled object files into a single archive
library via:

    ar crv $BUFRLIB *.o

where $BUFRLIB points to the desired pathname for the BUFRLIB archive library.
This archive library can then be easily linked whenever the user's application
program is subsequently compiled on the same local system.
