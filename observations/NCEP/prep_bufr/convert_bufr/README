The programs in this directory are used to convert binary BUFR files
into a format that works on Intel-processor based machines (e.g. Linux
clusters, SGI Altix systems).  They are not needed on IBM Power systems.

The main program is 'grabbufr', but it may need to be edited slightly to
run on your system.  First try compiling and running it as-is.  If it does
not work, use the 2 test programs 'stat_test' and 'arg_test' to diagnose
what changes should be made to the grabbufr.f source.

To compile 'grabbufr' you can look at the 'convert_bufr.csh' script, or
you can just compile it with your standard fortran compiler, adding in
the ../lib/bufrlib.a file.

The test programs are self-contained and require no additional libs.
