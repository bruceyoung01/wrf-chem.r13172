<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>
Real-world observations of earth-system data come from a variety of sources,
including radiosondes, satellites, ships, aircraft, weather stations, etc.  
The files in this <em class=code>observations</em> directory
can be used to convert data from a variety of native
formats into a common DART 
<em class=code>observation sequence</em> format.
</P><P>
Synthetic observations are those not based on an actual instrument reading of
a system, but instead are fabricated to have a known value, or have values
computed by running a model, possibly with a fixed amount of simulated noise
added. These observations can be used for testing, determining the
sensitivity of the model to assimilation, and for designing new observation systems.
The DART system includes several ways to create synthetic observations.
See the <a href="#Programs">Programs</a> section below for more details.
</P><P>
The DART framework enforces a clean separation between observations
and the models they are assimilated into.  The same observations can be
used in any model which understands how to generate a value for the requested
type of observation from its state space values.
</P><P>
In many cases a single, self-contained program can convert 
directly from the observation
location, time, value, and error into the DART format.  In other cases,
especially those linking with a complicated external library (e.g. BUFR),
there is a two-step process with two programs and an ASCII intermediate file.
We are currently leaning towards single-step conversions but either
approach can be used for new programs.
</P><P>
Frequently the original datasets are in a standard scientific
format like netCDF, HDF, or BUFR, and library routines for those
formats can be used to read in the original observation data.
</P><P>
The DART software distribution
includes Fortran subroutines and functions to help create
a sequence of observations in memory, and then a call to the 
DART observation sequence write routine
will create an entire <em class=code>obs_seq</em>
file in the correct format.
</P>
<!--
<P>
Describe other utils here as well - print, merge, superobs, subset, etc.  
anything that can be model independent.  Common back end.
</P>
-->
<P>
The DART system comes with several types of location modules for computing
distances appropriately.  Two of the
ones most commonly used are for data in a 1D system and for data in 
a 3D spherical coordinate system.  All the programs here assume the
<em class=file>location/threed_sphere/location_mod.f90</em> 3D sphere
location module is being used.
</P>

<P>
There are currently 
some additional observation sources and types which we are in the process
of collecting information and conversion programs for and which will
eventually be added to this directory.  In the meantime, if you have
converters for data or interest in something that is not in the
repository, please <a href="mailto:dart@ucar.edu">email the DART group</a>.
</P>

<H2>DATA SOURCES AND FORMATS</H2>
<P>
See the various subdirectories here, which generally include
information on where the example data was obtained and in what
format it is distributed. Most data is available for download off
the web.  The Data Support Section (DSS) at NCAR has large data
repositories, the MADIS data center distributes observations in
NetCDF format, GTS real-time weather data is available from various
sources. For new converters, 
if you can find what format the data is distributed in
you may be able to adapt one of the existing converters 
here for your own use.  
Formats read by the existing converters
include NetCDF, HDF, little-r, text, Prepbufr,
amongst others.
</P>
<P>
See the <a href="#Programs">Programs</a> section below for a list of
the current converter programs.
</P>
<P>
If you have looked and none of the existing converters are right
for your data, here are some suggestions for where to start creating
a new converter.  Create a new subdirectory in the <em class=file>observations</em>
directory.  Copy with the recursive option (<em class=code>cp -r</em>) one of
the existing converters and adapt to your needs.  Our suggestions for which
converter to start from depends on the format of your input observations
to be converted.  If your input data format is:
<DL>
<DT>netCDF</DT><DD>Start with the <em class=file>MADIS</em> converters,
and in particular try the <em class=file>convert_madis_profiler.f90</em>
file because it is the most straightforward.
</DD>
<DT>Comma separated text</DT><DD>Start with the <em class=file>Ameriflux</em> converter.
</DD>
<DT>Generic text</DT><DD>Start with the <em class=file>text</em> converter.
</DD>
<DT>HDF-EOS</DT><DD>Start with the <em class=file>AIRS</em> converter.
</DD>
<DT>BUFR or prepBUFR</DT><DD>Start with the <em class=file>NCEP</em> converter.
</DD>
<DT>Dense data, like Satellite swaths</DT><DD>Start with the <em class=file>tpw</em> converter,
which includes code that averages the raw data in space and time.
</DD>
<DT>Ray-path integrated data</DT><DD>Start with the <em class=file>GPS</em> converter,
which includes code that traces a path and integrates values along the ray.
</DD>
<DT>World Ocean Database packed ASCII</DT><DD>Start with the <em class=file>WOD</em> converter.

 formats here.   -->

<A NAME="Decisions"></A>
<div class="top">[<a href="#">top</a>]</div><hr />
<H2>DECISIONS YOU MIGHT NEED TO MAKE</H2>

<H4>Time</H4>

<P>
Time enters into
the assimilation system in 3 places: the timestamp of the
state vector data (the current model time when this data was produced),
the time of each observation, and the minimum time period the model
should be called to advance (the assimilation window size).  The
internal timestepping of the model is unrelated to any of these 
times and is outside the scope of the assimilation system.
</P><P>
The basic time type in DART is a pair of integers; one for
the day number and one for the number of seconds.  Generally the
low order models, which aren't direct geophysical models, use
time directly as a sequence of days starting at 0 and incrementing
in any appropriate number of seconds or days.  The observations
assimilated into these systems do not need to use a calendar.
</P><P>
Observations of a real-world system
usually are distributed with a year/month/day,
hour/min/seconds timestamp.  There are routines in DART
to convert back and forth between the (day-number/seconds) 
format and a variety of (year/month/day) calendars. 
See <a href="../time_manager/time_manager_mod.html#time_type">the
time manager documentation</a>
for more details on how DART stores time information and
the types of available calendars.  Some climate models which do
long runs (100s or 1000s of years) use a modified calendar
for simplicity in computation, e.g.  months which always 
have 30 days, or no leap years.  When trying to assimilate real
observations into these models there may be calendar issues to solve.
</P><P>
The smallest resolvable unit of time in DART is a second.
To model a system which operates on sub-second time scales
the time can be scaled up by some factor. As long as the
observation time, the state data time, and the minimum model
advance time are expressed in the same scaled time units,
there is no problem.
</P>

<H4>Error</H4>

<P>
Observations must specify an associated expected error.
Each individual observation stores its own error value,
so it can be a constant value for all observations of that
type or it can vary by location, by height, by magnitude of the
observed value, etc.  
This value is the expected instrument error plus
the representativeness error of the model.  
The model error includes deficiencies
in the equations representing the processes of the system
as well as errors introduced by representing a continuous
system as a series of discrete points.
While the instrument error and the representativeness error
could be specified separately, they each have the same
impact on the assimilation and can be difficult to determine
with any real accuracy.  For simplicity, in DART (and
most current assimilation software) they are
combined and specified as a single value.
</P><P>
The instrument error is generally supplied by the instrument
maker.  Sadly, it is frequently surprisingly
difficult to find these values.
For the representativeness error, a set of artificial
observations could be generated with the 
<a href="../perfect_model_obs/perfect_model_obs.html">perfect_model_obs</a>
program and an assimilation experiment could be run to
generate an estimate of the error in the model.
In practice however most people make an educated guess
on the values of the error and then start with a larger than
expected value and decrease it based on the results of
running some test assimilations.
For these tests the namelist for the
<a href="../filter/filter.html#Namelist">outlier threshold</a> 
should be disabled by setting it to -1 (the default value is 3). 
This value controls whether the observation is rejected
because the observed value is too far from the ensemble mean.
</P><P>
If the diagnostics show that the difference between the mean of
the forward operators and the observed value is consistently 
smaller than the specified observation error, then the error 
is probably too large.  
A too-large error reduces the impact of an
observation on the state.
If the specified observation error is too small it is
likely the observation will be rejected when the outlier
threshold is enabled, and the observation will not be 
assimilated.  It is important
to look at the output observation sequence files after an assimilation
to see how many observations were assimilated or rejected, and also at
the RMSE (<a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMSE">root mean squared error</a>) 
versus the total spread.  
DART includes Matlab diagnostic routines
to create these types of plots.  
The observation RMSE and total spread should be roughly
commensurate.  The total spread includes contributions from both
the ensemble variance and the observational error variance, so it
can be adjusted by changing the error values on the incoming observations.
There are other ways to adjust the ensemble spread, including
<A HREf="../filter/filter.html#Inflation">inflation</a>,
so the observation error is not the only factor to consider.
</P><P>
One last recommendation: if possible, the Prior forward operator values
should be compared against the observations after several assimilation
cycles.  If you plot results using the Posterior values
it is always possible for the assimilation to overfit the
observations and look good on the diagnostic plots.  But the
actual test is to then advance the model and look at how the
forecast of the state compares to the observations.
</P>

<H4>Types</H4>

<P>
All observations have to have a specific 'type'.  
There are namelist controls
to turn on and off the assimilation of observations at run-time
by type, or to only evaluate the forward operator for an observation
but have no impact on the state.  
Several of the diagnostics also group observations by
type to give aggregate statistics after an assimilation.
Generally types are based on both the observing platform or
instrument as well as the kind of observation, 
e.g. RADIOSONDE_TEMPERATURE, ARGO_SALINITY, etc.
Each type is associated with a single underlying generic 'kind',
which controls what forward operator code is called inside the
model, e.g. KIND_TEMPERATURE, KIND_DENSITY, etc.
</P><P>
See <a href="../obs_def/obs_def_mod.html">here</a> for more
details on how to use and add new DART types.
The DART obs_kind_mod.f90 defines a list of already defined
observation kinds, and users can either use existing observation
types in 'obs_def_xxx_mod.f90' files, or define their own.
</P>

<H4>Locations</H4>

<P>
The two most common choices for specifying the location of an
observation are the 
<a href="../location/threed_sphere/location_mod.html">threed_sphere</a>
and the
<a href="../location/oned/location_mod.html">oned</a>
locations.  For observations of a real-world system, the 3D Sphere
is generally the best choice.  For low-order, 1D models, the 1D
locations are the most commonly used.  The observation locations
need to match the type of locations used in the model.

</P>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/opaws/">
     Observation Processing And Wind Synthesis (OPAWS)</a>:
     OPAWS can process NCAR Dorade (sweep) and NCAR EOL Foray (netcdf) radar data.
     It analyzes (grids) data in either two-dimensions (on the conical surface of
     each sweep) or three-dimensions (Cartesian). Analyses are output in netcdf,
     Vis5d, and/or DART (Data Assimilation Research Testbed) formats.
</li>
</ul>
<P>
For generating synthetic observations, see the
<a href="../obs_sequence/create_obs_sequence.html">create_obs_sequence</a> 
program documentation.
You can also generate observation files based on text input.  See the
<a href="text/text_to_obs.html">text_to_obs</a> program documentation.
Or for simulating a large complex observing system, you can use the
DART library routines in a Fortran program to compute the observation
information and have the DART routines write the output file.
</P><P>
See the 
<a href="../perfect_model_obs/perfect_model_obs.html">perfect_model</a>
program documentation on how to run a model with a set of observations
that have only locations, types, and times, and have the forward operators
compute the observation values.
