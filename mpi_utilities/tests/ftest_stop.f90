program ftest_stop

! Test using named pipes to synchronize two separate executables.
! Used in the async=4 mode of running both a parallel filter and 
! a parallel model advance, where filter does not exit during the
! model advances.

! To execute this test:
!  Run this program in background and then run ftest_go to wake it up.

! The following 2 build tips are the 2 places where different installations
! of MPI seem to vary the most.  Some systems have an include file, some
! have a F90 module.  Some require an interface block to use the system()
! function, some give an error if it is here.   You can use this program
! to figure out which combinations work on your system.  Then go into the
! $DART/mpi_utilities and make the same two changes in mpi_utilities_mod.f90,
! and just the system() change (if needed) in null_mpi_utilities_mod.f90.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
! BUILD TIP 1:
! Most fortran MPI implementations provide either a fortran 90 module
! which defines the interfaces to the MPI library routines, or an include
! file which defines constants.  Try to use the module if it is available.

use mpi

implicit none

!include "mpif.h"

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
! BUILD TIP 2:
! Some systems require this interface block in order to use the system()
! function.  However, some other systems complain if this is here...
! If this is a problem your program will not link and most likely give 
! you an error about an undefined symbol (something like '_system_').  
! Comment this block in or out as needed.

  ! interface block for getting return code back from system() routine
  interface
   function system(string)
    character(len=*) :: string
    integer :: system
   end function system
  end interface

subroutine block_task()

! block by reading a named pipe file until some other task
! writes a string into it.  this ensures the task is not
! spinning and using CPU cycles, but is asleep waiting in
! the kernel.   one subtlety with this approach is that even
! though named pipes are created in the filesystem, they are
! implemented in the kernel, so on a multiprocessor machine
! the write into the pipe file must occur on the same PE as
! the reader is waiting.  see the 'wakeup_filter' program for
! the MPI job which spreads out on all the PEs for this job
! and writes into the file from the correct PE.
