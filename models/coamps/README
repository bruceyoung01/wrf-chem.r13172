To use this model, you must go to the COAMPS web site 
(at http://www.nrlmry.navy.mil/coamps-web/web/home ) 
and download the COAMPS model.

Then go into the shell_scripts directory and run
the initialize_dart.sh script to set up the necessary
files before trying to build the programs in the work directory.

Since you have these files, we assume you have already
downloaded the DART code.  If not, go here to register
and get information about checking DART out from subversion:
