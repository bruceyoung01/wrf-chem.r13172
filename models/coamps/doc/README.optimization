Optimization hints for DART/COAMPS

When dealing with a large model with a number of configuration options,
the methods of optimization are varied.  However, here are some general
guidelines:

1. Use single-precision instead of double-precision real numbers

This can be accomplished by altering the compilation of the COAMPS code.
Before using the resulting model for a DART run, change the C_REAL 
parameter (which gives the size of the REAL in the COAMPS restart files)
accordingly.

2. Choose as large a timestep as possible

As with any model, there are stability concerns if the timestep grows
too large.  However, COAMPS includes a 'chekts' routine that warns the
user if the timestep is too large for the domain configuration.  If the
timestep exceeds what chekts thinks it should be, it will print a 
warning in the COAMPS log file.

3. Wisely partition the domain

The COAMPS model is built to support domain decomposition across a large
number of processors.  However, as with any other multiple-process application,
there is a tradeoff between the speed gained by adding more processors
and the speed lost by passing information between those processors.  The
COAMPS documentation suggests that about 30 points per processor in
each direction is optimal - this will of course depend on the particular
configuration.  For example, a user with a 90x60 model domain would do
well to choose 3x2 domain decomposition.
