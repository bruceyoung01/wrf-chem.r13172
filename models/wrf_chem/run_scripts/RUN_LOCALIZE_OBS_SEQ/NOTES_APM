Settings for VERTISxxx
-2	-  no vertical location
-1	-  surface value
 1	-  level
 2	-  pressure
 3	-  height
 4	-  scale height

Setting for select_localization
 1	-  Gaspari-Cohn
 2	-  Boxcar
 3	-  Ramped Boxcar

For rejection/localization try:
VERTISxxx = 4
vertical location = .35 of one scale height

z_in = distance of target_loc from obs_loc (in scale height if negative then target_obs is above (higher than) obs_loc

when obs_type=MOPITT_CO_RETRIEVAL
if z_in < 0 use Gaspari-Cohn
if z_in > 0 use Boxcar

CHECK THE location_nml settings
they probably should be
nlon = 71
nlat = 36
vertical_normalization_scale_height = 10.0 (Glen resets this to 1.5)
vertical_normalization_pressure = 666666.7

NOTE: These may need to be changed in the namelist scripts and run scripts.
