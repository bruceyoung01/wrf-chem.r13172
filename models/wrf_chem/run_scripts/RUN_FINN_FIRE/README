# DART $Id: $

IMPORTANT: The WRF-Chem build mechanism has been replaced by the DART mkmf mechanism.
           All that is needed to build fire_emis is to run
           quickbuild.csh   in the  RUN_FINN_FIRE/work directory.
           The environment from the mkmf.template is used, so there is no further
           customization needed. As per the WRF-Chem/DART developers policy, the
           executable has a '.exe' extension, which is an addition to the 
           native naming scheme.

This code comes from the NCAR/ACOM FINN fire source code directory.

The data files are archived in the INPUT DATA directory for WRF-Chem/DART.
