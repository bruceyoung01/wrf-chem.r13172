#
# Shell script to run the WRF model from DART input.
# where the model advance is executed as a separate process.
#
# This script performs the following:
# 1.  Creates a temporary directory to run a WRF realization (see options)
# 2.  Copies or links the necessary files into the temporary directory
# 3.  Converts DART state vectors to wrf input
# 4.  Updates LBCs (optionally draws perturbations from WRF-Var random covariances)
# 5.  Writes a WRF namelist from a template
# 6.  Runs WRF
# 7.  Checks for incomplete runs
# 8.  Converts wrf output to DART state vectors
#
# NOTES:
# 1.  This version executes da_wrfvar.exe in serial (no mpirun)
# 2.  If the ensemble mean assim_model_state_ic_mean is present in the 
# $CENTRALDIR, it is converted to a WRF netCDF format.
# It is then used in update_wrf_bc to calculate the deviation from the mean.
# This deviation from the mean is then added at the end of the interval to
# calculate new boundary tendencies. The magnitude of the perturbation added
# at the end of the interval is controlled by infl. The purpose is to increase
# time correlation at the lateral boundaries.
#
# POSSIBLE TODO
# 1.  modularization?  
# 2.  error checking all over

# this next section could be somewhere else in some docs.  If so
# reference is needed ("for more information about how to run this, see ...")

#-------------------------------------------------------
# Dependencies (user responsibility)
#-------------------------------------------------------
# REQUIRED:
# 1. advance_time (from DART), located in your $CENTRALDIR
# 2. one of either (da_wrfvar.exe and pert_wrf_bc) or update_wrf_bc if you 
# want to run real-data cases with specified LBCs.  Elaborated below.
# 3. directory $CENTRALDIR/WRF_RUN containing all the WRF run-time files
# (typically files with data for the physics: LANDUSE.TBL, RRTM_DATA, etc
# but also anything else you want to link into the wrf-run directory.  If
# using WRF-Var then be.dat should be in there too.
# 4. wrf.exe, located in your $CENTRALDIR 
# 5. A wrfinput_d01 file in your $CENTRALDIR.  
# 6. namelist.input in your $CENTRALDIR for use as a template.  This file 
# should include the WRF-Var namelists if you are using WRF-Var (v3.1++ required).
#
# OPTIONAL:
# ####EITHER 1 or 2 is required for specified LBC runs
# 1.  da_wrfvar.exe (version 3.1 or later) and pert_wrf_bc in your $CENTRALDIR/WRF_RUN.
# In this case you also need be.dat (the be.dat.cv3 file from the WRF-Var 
# distribution) in your $CENTRALDIR/WRF_RUN, and WRF-Var namelists in 
# your $CENTRALDIR/namelist.input
# 2.  update_wrf_bc in your $CENTRALDIR for using pre-existing LBC files. Pre-existing LBC files should live in $CENTRALDIR/WRF

# File naming conventions:
#  mean wrfinput - wrfinput_d0X_${gday}_${gsec}_mean
#  mean wrfbdy - wrfbdy_d01_${gday}_${gsec}_mean
#  wrfbdy members - wrfbdy_d01_${gday}_${gsec}_${member}
