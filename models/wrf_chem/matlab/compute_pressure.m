%% FUNCTION pres : Computes pressure from gas law as in WRF.
%
% CS version of Ryan's m-file.
% Computes pressure from gas law as in WRF.
%
% alpha = inverse density of dry air, computed from hydrostatic relation
% for the dry air:  - dphi/deta = -mu alpha.
%
% Inputs:  
%	mu    =   (full) dry hydrostatic surf. press (2d)
%	dnw   =   intervals between w levels, at mass pts
%	phi   =   (full) geopotential, at w pts
%   theta =   (full) potential temperature, at mass pts 
%   qv    =   water-vapor mixing ratio, at mass pts 
%	Rd,Rv,gamma,p0
%	      =   dry and moist gas constants, c_p/c_v, reference pressure
% Output:
%	pres  =   (full) pressure, at mass pts
%
% See wrf subroutine calc_p_rho_phi.
