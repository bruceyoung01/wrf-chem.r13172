Contained is the model_mod.f90 file for use with the Ikeda map, a 2D chaotic 
map useful for visualization of data assimilation updating directly in state
space.  There are three parameters:  a, b, & mu.  The state is 2D, x = [X Y].
The equations are:

X(i+1) = 1 + mu * ( X(i) * cos( t ) - Y(i) * sin( t ) )
Y(i+1) =     mu * ( X(i) * sin( t ) + Y(i) * cos( t ) ), 
where
t = a - b / ( X(i)**2 + Y(i)**2 + 1 )

Note the system is time-discrete already, meaning there is no delta_t.  The
system stems from nonlinear optics (Ikeda 1979, Optics Communications).

The model_mod.f90 file is very similar to that of the lorenz_63 system.


I have also included an updated input.nml file, which is again very similar
to that used by the lorenz_63 system, differing only in the model_nml 
entries.

Included also is an updated suite of the path_names files.  I updated all
those present in the template directory, though I don't believe all are
used by the system (for instance, integrate_model).  

Lastly, I found that I needed to update several of the matlab diagnostics 
in order to use them (they register which model is being used and complain
if the current one is unrecognized).  Almost all the modifications were 
simply adding 'ikeda' into the switch / case structures.  I didn't modify 
all the matlab code, only the routines necessary to run the diagnostics 
I thought most relevant / illuminating (plot_ens_err_spread, plot_bins, &
plot_total_err).  I have included these updated files in a subdirectory 
called /matlab.


I have essentially stuck to only the required fields to render a model
DART compliant.  I noticed that lorenz_63 includes some extra subroutines
beyond what template (and the /docs directory) claims is required for 
DART compliance.  These extra subroutines include:  linear_dt, 
inv_linear_dt, and linearize.  I didn't write versions of these for the 
ikeda map -- are they necessary?


Lastly, I have left many of the code comments in model_mod.f90 from the 
original template file.  If that is bad form, then I can go back and 
remove them.  Please let me know.

Thanks,

Greg Lawson

No worries.  I can extend the 'default' matlab routines to support the
ikeda model - your routines were useful guidelines -- thanks.

I removed all the (original) code comments - while they may have been useful
to you (the code developer), I looked at the difference between the 
comments and the code and would guess that it would probably do more to 
confuse the casual 'observer' than help. Basically, I made a command decision
not to include "clutter" in the version going into the repository.

The extra routines are just that -- so what you gave me was perfect. Thanks!
