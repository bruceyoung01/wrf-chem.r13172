function h=imagescn(x,y,c)
%IMAGESCN - ImageSC with Nonlinear axis.
%   IMAGESCN(X,Y,C) creates a 2D plot analogous to imagesc in that given
%   the centers of rectangles and colors, it draws them (centered), but
%   DOES allow (as opposed to IMAGESC(X,Y,C)) for nonlinear axis spacing 
%   without throwing away the last row and last column of data, as does
%   PCOLOR(X,Y,C). To do that it has to guess what the rectangle sizes are
%   and particularly it uses LINEAR extrapolation to guess the size of the
%   last row and column.
%
%   Feel free to use as a draft for your own functions.

%If you look in "help pcolor", you'll see that pcolor with default shading
%doesn't use the last row and column of c, but needs it to be the same size 
%as x and y, so here, I just copy the values already in there (to keep 
%max(c) and min(c) the same)

c(:,end+1)=c(:,end);
