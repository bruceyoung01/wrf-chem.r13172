middle_run_gitm=${wd}/work/advance_temp_e21/UA #what middle-gitm run data files you want to plot (don't have to be in ${wd}) (as in 3DALL_t*.b0001) #the middle run is different from the true one because of f107 it uses - I want to see what "middle of ensembe" would do if I just let it run without adjusting it. For example, if truth is 150 and ensemble is centered about 130, then I want to run three simulations: the truth (without assimilation, f=150), the middle (without assimilation, f=130) and the ensemble with assimilation (f is adjusted on the fly). right now middle_run_gitm is set to be the same as truth_run_dir, but that's only to check if all the files are in the right places - change this when you do the actual runs.
