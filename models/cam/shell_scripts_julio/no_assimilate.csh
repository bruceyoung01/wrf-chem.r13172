# Preliminary clean up, which can run in the background.
# ATM_forcXX, CESM1_5's new archiver has a mechanism for removing restart file sets 
# which we don't need, but it runs ony after the (multicycle) job finishes.  
# It moves the files which need to be archived from RUNDIR to ../../${CASE}.locked 
# and makes (redundant) HARD LINKS in archive/rest/$date and archive/${component}/rest.
# Those hard links are different names for the same physical file.
# Removing one of them, or the original physical file name, does not make the file 
# disappear; the file can still be accessed by the remaining names.
# So we need to remove all names of a file.
# This will remove them during a multicycle run, reducing the need to stop
# to clear scratch space, and preventing {st,lt}_archive from archiving them.
