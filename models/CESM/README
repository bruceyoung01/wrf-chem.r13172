This is the start of an interface for assimilating observations
into the fully-coupled CESM whole-system model.  It makes use
of the existing POP (ocean), CLM (land), and CAM (atmosphere) 
model_mod codes.

We have adopted some terminology to help us keep things straight.
1) CESM already uses the term 'fully-coupled', so we use that in
   reference to CESM components only.
2) We use the term 'single-component, fully-coupled' to denote the
   situation in which the assimilations are performed separately for
   any/all active model components. Atmospheric obs directly impact 
   the atmosphere, ocean obs directly impact the ocean, land obs 
   directly impact the land - any impact from the atmosphere to the ocean
   happens through interaction with the CESM coupler.
3) 'cross-component, fully-coupled' is used to specify the case
   when observations of one component can directly impact any/all of
   the other components without going through the coupler.

Prior to 9 Nov 2015, models/CESM  had programs that were an attempt to
achieve the cross-component, fully-coupled data assimilation. Since
this is being implemented with the Remote Memory Access (RMA) strategy
that is not consistent with the current SVN trunk, the files that allow
that usage pattern are being removed from the SVN trunk.

Only the single-component, fully-coupled assimilation pattern will 
be supported in the SVN trunk.

The models/CESM/work directory has nothing of use in it, since there 
are no programs to interact with a cross-component DART state vector
(a DART state that consists of atmosphere and/or ocean and/or land).

The models/CESM/shell_scripts directory DOES have the scripts that 
illustrate how to set up and run a single-component, fully-coupled 
assimilation.
