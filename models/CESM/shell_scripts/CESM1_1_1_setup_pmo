# ---------------------
# Purpose
# ---------------------
#
# This script is designed to set up, stage, and build a single-instance run
# of CESM using a B compset where CAM, POP, and CLM are all active. The
# initial state can come from a single multi-instance reference case so a
# CESM hybrid setup is used.
#
# While not required for CESM, POP is configured to write out netCDF
# restart files because they are required by DART (if you are going
# to assimilate ocean obs).
#
# This script has a counterpart that is a multi-instance setup for either a
# free run or an assimilation experiment. To make it easy to maintain (and
# hopefully understand), the two scripts are intended to parallel each other.
# That means this script performs a lot of manipulation of the 'instance'
# portion of the filenames, which seems unnecessary initially.
#
# CESM/DART requires some modifications to the CESM source code EVEN IF YOU
# ARE NOT USING DART. The modifications for CAM require a change to the CESM
# ${CASE}.run script to invoke a DART script that will allow CAM to cycle
# correctly with the source code modifications. Changing one line will
# allow you to invoke DART.
#
# This script results in a viable setup for a CESM single instance experiment.
# You are STRONGLY encouraged to run the single instance CESM a few times and
# experiment with different settings BEFORE you try to generate 'perfect'
# observations. You should become comfortable using CESM's restart capability
# to re-stage files in your RUN directory.
#
# ${CASEROOT}/CESM_DART_config is automatically run by this script and will
# augment the CESM case with the required setup and configuration to use DART
# to harvest synthetic observations. CESM_DART_config will insert a few dozen
# lines into the ${case}.run script after it makes a backup copy.
#
# The methodology here reflects that atmosphere assimilations typically
# occur every 6 hours. All of CESM stops every 6 hours (requiring the
# ocean to couple 4x per day) so that a CAM output file would be available
# for assimilation.
#
#
# This script relies heavily on the information in:
# http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm1.1/cesm/doc/usersguide/book1.html
#
# ---------------------
# How to use this script.
# ---------------------
#
# -- You will have to read and understand the script in its entirety.
#    You will have to modify things outside this script.
#    This script sets up a plain CESM single-instance run without DART,
#    intentionally.  Once it is running, calls to DART can be added.
#
# -- Examine the whole script to identify things to change for your experiments.
#
# -- Edit this script in the $DART/models/CESM/shell_scripts directory
#    or copy it to somewhere where it will be preserved.
#
# -- Locate the initial condition files that CESM will need.
#
# -- Run this script. When it is executed, it will create:
#    1) a CESM 'CASE' directory, where the model will be built,
#    2) a run directory, where each forecast will take place,
#    3) a bld directory for the executables.
#    4) The short term archiver will use a fourth directory for
#    storage of model output until it can be moved to long term storage (HPSS)
#
#    This script also executes ${CASEROOT}/CESM_DART_config to modify
#    the ${CASEROOT}/${CASE}.run script so that the SourceMods for CAM
#    are effective. CESM_DART_config will also augment the case with all
#    the pieces necessary to run DART when the time comes.
#
# -- (if running DART) Edit the DART input.nml that appears in the ${CASEROOT}
#    directory.
#
# -- Submit the job using ${CASEROOT}/${CASE}.submit
#
# ---------------------
# Important features
# ---------------------
#
# If you want to change something in your case other than the runtime
# settings, it is safest to delete everything and start the run from scratch.
# For the brave, read
#
# http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm1.1/cesm/doc/usersguide/x1142.html

# "A hybrid run indicates that CESM is initialized more like a startup, but uses
# initialization datasets from a previous case. This is somewhat analogous to a
# branch run with relaxed restart constraints. A hybrid run allows users to bring
# together combinations of initial/restart files from a previous case (specified
# by $RUN_REFCASE) at a given model output date (specified by $RUN_REFDATE).
# Unlike a branch run, the starting date of a hybrid run (specified by $RUN_STARTDATE)
# can be modified relative to the reference case. In a hybrid run, the model does not
# continue in a bit-for-bit fashion with respect to the reference case. The resulting
# climate, however, should be continuous provided that no model source code or
# namelists are changed in the hybrid run. In a hybrid initialization, the ocean
# model does not start until the second ocean coupling (normally the second day),
# and the coupler does a "cold start" without a restart file."
#
# TJH:
# DART's CAM implementation causes a bit more complexity. DART only uses CAM _initial_
# files, not RESTART files, so there are sourcemods to force a hybrid start for CAM to
# read initial files - even when CONTINUE_RUN = TRUE. A hybrid start is better for POP
# because the velocities are used rather than just T,S. A hybrid start is also more
# desirable because initial values can be specified for ROF - as opposed to just zeros.
#
# The RUN_REFCASE/REFDATE/REFTOD  are used by CLM & RTM to specify the namelist input
# filenames - BUT - their buildnml scripts do not use the INSTANCE, so they all specify
# the same (single) filename. This is remedied by using patched [clm,rtm].buildnml.csh
# scripts that exist in the SourceMods directory.
