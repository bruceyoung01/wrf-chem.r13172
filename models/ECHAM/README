There are several DART users who have working DART interface code
to the ECHAM atmospheric general circulation model.  This model
is developed and supported by the Max Planck Institute for Meterology 
in Hamburg, Germany.

See here:

http://www.mpimet.mpg.de/en/science/models/echam.html

for more information on the model.  

If you are interested in running DART with this model please contact 
the DART group at 'dart@ucar.edu' for more information.  We currently do
not have a copy of the model_mod interface code nor any of the scripting 
required to run an assimilation, but we may be able to put you in contact 
with the right people to get it.
