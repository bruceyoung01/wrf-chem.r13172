The rose model is a research model that is still being
developed. The DART components here are simply to help
the rose developers with the DART framework.

The DART/models/rose/work/workshop_setup.csh script
is SUPPOSED to fail without the rose code.

Since the DART subversion repository intentionally
does not contain the rose source code ...

Mon Mar 22 17:23:20 MDT 2010 : the rose project has been subtantially streamlined.

assumed those responsibilities.
