# DART $Id$

COAMPS DART import TODO list:

X Define DART state vector
X Identify the restart files needed for the model to run
X Handle DART<->COAMPS conversion
  	X state vector conversion
	X time conversion
X Implement DART functions
	X get_model_size
	X get_state_meta_data
	X get_model_time_step
	X static_init_model
	X nc_write_model_atts
	X nc_write_model_vars
X clean up and appropriately modify advance_model.csh
X put in proper modules in the mkmf stuff
X write namelist parser/condenser
X verify
X Allow dynamic switching from real*4 to real*8
X Rewrite translation modules for restart files rather than flat files
X Rewrite translation programs to reflect changes in modules.
X Redo dynamic choices of restart files - quick static fix in there for now.
X Fix model_mod to include the new dynamic state definition
X Allow for parallel DA
X Include terrain height in COAMPS grid information
X Convert COAMPS innovation files to DART observations
X Incorporate KIND information in the dynamic state definition
X Implement ability to get a restart index based on a name/sigma index
X Implement additional DART functions
	X model_get_close_states (FIX)
	X model_interpolate
X Add in capability to read/process w levels in datahd file
X Interpolate sea level pressure 
X Include dynamic perturbations in model_mod
X Allow the omission of fields to write to restart files (like mean values)
X Allow namelist parser to handle multiple entries per line
X Let converter write single REALS instead of an entire field
X Rewrite converter to allow files written by multiple I/O processes
X Allow vertical interpolation code to use type R8
X Check for positive definite quantities in restart vector
X Allow for interpolation onto Z surfaces as well as P
X Allow converter to not write boundaries
_ Allow for longer integration times by adjusting DTG
X Audit all REAL variables to force COAMPS/DART type (either 4 or 8)
X Use the IOSTAT option in all the OPEN commands
X Rename coamps_util_mod as coamps_restart_mod and propagate changes
X Clean up and reorder the source code files
X Allow get_restart_index_by_properties to return -1 if not found
- Speed up model_get_close_states
X Allow entire variables in dynamic state rather than just level by level
  (accomplished using shell script - keep as level by level in the main
   restart.vars file)
_ Add resilience to read_restart_vars
    _ Skip if the sigma level is higher than the model's maximum
    _ Resize the restart_vars array to be the number of elements
      successfully processed, not the number at the top of the file
_ Modify the converter to process the model mean state separately
