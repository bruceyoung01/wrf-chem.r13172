Notes on adding support for COAMPS aerosols
-------------------------------------------

The aerosol restart file is a separate entity (named as 'restarta1c' vs. 
'restarta1p') than the atmospheric restart file. The contents are variable,
depending on the number of species and the number of sources in use.

The number of passive tracer species is "mspc"
The number of emission sites or locations is "nsrc"
 - this is used with general point/area-source tracer emissions and
   a regular setup with lat/lon/height of emission site locations given
   by cntlat/cntlon/cnthgt
The number of size bins in the dust component is "mdust"
