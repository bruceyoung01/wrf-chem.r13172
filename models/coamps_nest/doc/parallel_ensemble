Prototyping a Parallel Ensemble Run
-----------------------------------

Current Method:
Currently, ensemble members are run sequentially.  The
advance_ensemble script calls the advance_model script for the first
ensemble member, waits for its completion, then calls advance_model
for the second ensemble member, etc.

Desired Behavior:
What we want is to be able to specify how many ensemble members we can
run concurrently.  This will require checking out N*n processors,
where N is the number of processors required to run 1 instance of the
model and n is the number of concurrent runs to process.

Plan:
The ensemble is managed by keeping an array where element i
corresponds to the ith ensemble member.  If the member has completed
successfully, then this contains "RAN".  If the member has not yet
run, this contains "NOTRAN".

Pseudocode:
1. Initialize member completed array (NOTRAN)
2. Set the number of running members to zero
3. Set the number of completed members to zero
4. WHILE (the number of completed members < ens_size)
   a. IF # of running members < n
      i.   Find the next member that hasn't ran
      ii.  Set that status to "running"
      iii. Increment the running counter
      iv.  Run the model
   b. FOREACH response in the pipe (response is member number)
      i.   Set that status to "ran"
      ii.  Decrement the running counter
      iii. Increment the finished counter
