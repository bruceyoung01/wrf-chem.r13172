# This perl script generates a file that can be redirected into
# create_obs_seequence.  For the MITgcm annulus the script 
# requires 10 pieces of information from STDIN.  As the MITgcm
# configuration currently stands, there are 5 different variables
# that are assimilated, and the user is free to specify the 
# observational density and error covariance for each of the five
# variables independently.  The script assumes that the output
# filename is set_def.out, and it assumes a single uniqe observation 
# set.
#
# The user inputs are the spacing between observations for each
# of the five variable types (the script figures
# out the resulting observation locations under the assumption
# that the first observation is at location 1) and the observational
# variance for each of the five variables (the script assumes all 
# observations of that variable have the same error variance).
#
# After running this script, the user runs the command:
#
#    ./create_obs_sequence < coseq.dat

# specify the dimensions in the different directions
$naz=120;
$nrad=31;
$nzed=29;

# specify the number of elements per variable = naz*nrad*nzed
$statesize = $naz*$nrad*$nzed;

# construct a mask for where the fluid is!
$icount=0;
for ($k = 1; $k <= $nzed; $k++) {
 for ($j = 1; $j <= 8; $j++) {
  for ($i = 1; $i <= $naz;  $i++) {
   $icount++;
   $mask[$icount]=0;
  }
 }
 for ($j = 9; $j <= $nrad; $j++) {
  for ($i = 1; $i <= $naz;  $i++) {
   $icount++;
   $mask[$icount]=1;
  }
