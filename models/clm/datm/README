The coupler history files produced by the CAM assimilation are 
HPSS:/RAEDER/DAI/POP_force/POP15/obs_####/H_cplr.ha2x1d.gz.tar 

bluefire:/ptmp/raeder/POP_force/doy_table_1997-2010 is required to
decode the #### in the file names. Here is the synopsis.

1998   1/ 1,  1/16,  1/31:   32 -  47 -  62

  E#   = ensemble member
  YYYY = year
  MM   = month
  DD   = day

These have all the forcing fields written out from CAM, but since
each one resulted from a cold-start of CAM, they all have the
same time array ...  time = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1 ; which (surprisingly)
has no "units" metadata.

Ultimately, we want to repackage these into annual files (about 1.8Gb),
one per ensemble member. This requires us to overwrite the existing 
time information such that the time variable in each file has the same
units, i.e.,   time:units = "days since ${year}-01-01 00:00:00" ;

While we're at it, I'm also including a 'time_bnds' array that defines
the start and stop of the averaging period.

GetCPLHISTdata.lsf      ... acquires and unpacks the data from the HPSS
Process6hrlyCPLHIST.csh ... corrects the time array data/metadata and packages into a month
AppendMonths.csh        ... packs all the days for a month into one annual file
