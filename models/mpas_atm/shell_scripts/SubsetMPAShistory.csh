# This script simply pares down an MPAS history file to a more 'tidy' size,
# at the expense of losing information we may need but currently do not 
# envision needing.
#
# DART needs the following coordinate variables:
# xtime                    coordinate variable
# latCell                  coordinate variable
# lonCell                  coordinate variable
# zgrid                    coordinate variable
# cellsOnVertex            coordinate variable
#
# theta                    potential state vector component
# uReconstructZonal        potential state vector component
# uReconstructMeridional   potential state vector component
# w                        potential state vector component
# qv                       potential state vector component
# qc                       potential state vector component
# qr                       potential state vector component
# qi                       potential state vector component
# qs                       potential state vector component
# qg                       potential state vector component
#
# surface_pressure         chosen because it is only (Time,nCells)
# edgeNormalVectors        needed by statevector_to_analysis_file()
# nEdgesOnCell             needed by statevector_to_analysis_file()
# u                        needed by statevector_to_analysis_file()
# dzs                      just to get the 'nSoilLevels' dimension
