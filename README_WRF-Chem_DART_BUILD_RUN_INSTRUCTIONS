This file contains instructions for building and running the WRF-Chem/DART 
release and test case.

INTRODUCTION:

The WRF-Chem/DART release is a "cleaned-up" version of my working/development
directories.  As such, it is set up to run the WRF-Chem/DART test case with a
minimum amount of effort: some user changes to adapt the compiler, mathematical 
libraries, and ksh scripts to your local system will be necessary. At present,
the Intel compiler has been tested and there are some routines that require the
Intel Math Kernel Libraries.

Since it is my working directory the distribution includes code that works and
is tested, code that runs but has not been tested, and code that simply does
not work yet. Once you have the test case running and want to test other features 
of WRF-Chem/DART you should contact me at mizzi@ucar.edu to find out the 
status of such features.

If you have questions about WRF-Chem/DART you should contact me because there
is not yet a Users Guide.  If your questions are more closely related to DART 
you should contact DART support at dart@ucar.edu.  In the event your question
is WRF-Chem/DART related they will pass it along to me.

Once WRF-Chem is built and you are able to run the test case, I suggest you
work through the run script to learn how it is structured and to learn the
steps/tasks that are required for regional ensemble chemical weather
forecasting/data assimilation. Once you understand the flow of the run
script you will be in a position to make modifications and start your
experiments.  Here again, I suggest you discuss your intended modifications
and experiments with me in advance.  This is an unfortunate result of not
having a Users Guide, but it has worked well for the existing users.

FUNDING/SUPPORT:

The WRF-Chem/DART project began in mid-2012 as a cooperative effort at the 
National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) between the Data Assimilation 
Research Section (DAReS) and the Atmospheric Chemistry Observations and Modeling 
Laboratory (ACOM) based on funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and 
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).  In mid-2017, ACOM's 
support for this project ceased.  Currently, WRF-Chem/DART is supported by the 
Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment/Air Pollution Control Division 
(CDPHE/APCD), the University of Colorado Department of Mechanical Engineering (CUME) 
and Research Computing Program (CURC), and DAReS.  In addition WRF-Chem/DART 
contributions have been made by the: York University, University of California at 
Berkeley, Nanjing University, University of Colorado, and University of Arizona.

TEST CASE DATA:

The test case data for WRF-Chem/DART can be retrieved using the Globus data service. 
If you do not have Globus, you can go here to sign up: https://www.globusid.org.  Once
you are logged into Globus, the files you want are here:

Host Endpoint: NCAR Data Sharing Service
Host Path:     /glade/datashare/nancy/WRF_CHEM_DART_DATA_FILES

There are two files in this directory.  The input files are in PANDA_REAL_TIME_DATA.tgz, 
and the output files are in real_PANDA_RETR_VARLOC_RELEASE_TST.tgz.  These files should 
be readable by anyone, but be forewarned, they are very large.  The input files 67 GB, and
the output files are 99 GB (tarred and compressed). 

The test case domain is eastern Asia.  It runs the Initial Cycle on 18 UTC July 24, 2014 
and the First Assimilation Cycle on 00 UTC July, 25, 2014.  It assimilates conventional 
meteorological observations and MOPITT CO retrieval profiles as raw retrievals.  The script
for running the test case is described in Step 7 of the BUILD INSTRUCTIONS.  For questions 
about accessing the data, please contact dart@ucar,edu.  For questions about the data, please 
contact me at mizzi@ucar.edu.   

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:

1. In this discussion "../" will refers to your DART home directory.
Also, it assumes that you have DART, WRF-Chem, WPS, and WRFDA built and
running on your system.

2. Go to the "../mkmf" directory, copy the appropriate
"mkmf.template.compiler_type.etc" into "mkmf.template", and modify/adapt
"mkmf.template" to your system.

3. Go to "../models/wrf_chem/work" and run "./quickbuild.csh". If this
step completes successfully, you should have some 30 WRF-Chem/DART
executables in this "work" directory.

4. Go to "../observations" and run "./buildall.csh".  This will build the
observation converters, which convert observations from their native format
to DART format.  If this step completes successfully you should have
observation converter executables in the observation type "work" directories.
NOTE: "buildall.csh" is configured to build the observation converters commonly
used in WRF-Chem/DART.  If you want other observation converters, you will
need to build them manually or modify "buildall.csh" to add them to the build
list.

5. Go to "../models/wrf_chem/run_scripts" and run "./buildall.csh".  This
will build the WRF-Chem/DART support utilites.  If this step completes
successfully, you should have WRF-Chem/DART utility executables (indicated by
a ".exe" extension) in the utility "work" directory.  "buildall.csh" will
build all WRF-Chem/DART utility executable existing as of the date of this
release.  However, WRF-Chem/DART does not use all these executables because
some are under development and some are legacy software.

6. Go to "../models/wrfchem/hybrid_scripts" and modify the
"da_run_hold_cu.ksh" and "job_script_summit.ksh" scripts for your system.
"da_run_hold_cu.ksh" is used by the run script to test whether all ensemble
members have completed computing on a specific task.
"job_script_summit.ksh" is the batch job submission script. It has "SERIAL"
and "PARALLEL" job submission options.  It will likely need to be modified to
accomodate your particular job scheduler/load manager.

7. Go to "../models/wrf_chem/runs_scripts/RUN_REAL/FINAL_TEST_SCRIPTS" and
edit the "real_time_PANDA_RETR_RELEASE_TEST_CU.ksh" script for your system.
The is the test case run script.  You will need to edit: 
 (i) "CODE VERSIONS" variables to match your code version and identifiers; 
 (ii) "ROOT DIRECTORIES" variables to match the root paths on your system.  
      You should not need to change the "DEPENDENT INPUT DATA DIRECTORIES" variables; 
 (iii) For now, you should not need to change the "SELECT COMPONENT RUN OPTIONS" variables, 
       but remember this section because these switches control the various job
       submission tasks in WRF-Chem/DART; 
 (iv) You may need to change the "COMPUTER PARAMETERS" to match the options 
      you set in "job_script_summit.ksh" for your particular scheduler/load manager; 
 (v) You should not need to change the "RUN_DIRECTORIES" variables; and 
 (vi) Finally, I have found that different machines have different "ksh" implementation 
      quirks.  You will likely need to modify the run script to address any differences
      in the version of "ksh" on your machine.

8. You are now ready to run the first two cycles of the WRF-Chem/DART test
case called "real_PANDA_RETR_VARLOC_RELEASE_TEST".  The first cycle is call
the "Initial Cycle" and the second is called the "First Assimilation Cycle".
There is no data assimilation in the "Initial Cycle". This cycle sets up the
initial ensemble and generates the initial forecast ensemble.  The "First
Assimilaton Cycle" generates an input ensemble to get the lateral boundary
conditions for the forecast step.  It also collects the relevant observations,
conducts the ensemble data assimilation (both meteorological and chemical
data assimilation), updates the lateral boundary conditions to account for
changes to the data assimilation, and generates the forecast ensemble.
That completes the first two cycles.

9. The date-time string for the Initial Cycle is "2014071418" - that means
July 14, 2014 at 18:00 UTC.  To run the "Initial Cycle" you should not need
to make changes to the CYCLE_STR_DATE or the CYCLE_END_DATE variables.  
Also you should not need to change any of the "SELECT COMPONENT RUN OPTIONS"
variables.  To run the "First Assimilation Cycle" you will need to change
the "CYCLE_STR_DATE" and "CYCLE_END_DATE" to "2014071500" and set
"RUN_GEOGRID" to "false".

10. When you submit the run_script, it should create the
${SCRATCH_DIR}/real_PANDA_RETR_VARLOC_RELEASE directory. Inside that
directory, you should see the following directories: "2014072418" and
"geogrid".  The 2014072418 directory contains the runtime output for the
"First Assimilation Cycle" and "geogrid" contains data for creating the WRF
input files.  After completing the "First Assimilation Cycle" this directory
with also have the "pert_file_emiss" and "pert_file_icbc" files.  These files
contain perturbation information for the emission and initial/boundary
condition perturbations.

11. If the "Initial Cycle" completes successfully, you should make the changes 
described in Step 9 to run the First Assimilation Cycle.  If your runs are successful, 
the output should resemble the output in the test case output data files.

Thank you for using WRF-Chem/DART.  Good luck!  
And please don't hesitate to contact me with questions.
