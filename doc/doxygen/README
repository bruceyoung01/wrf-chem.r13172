Doxygen automatic documentation generation.

To create html pages from the DART source:

- You must have doxygen installed somewhere on your search path.  
  From a terminal window type 'which doxygen'.  For Linux systems
  in many cases this is already installed.  For Macs try one of
  the package managers like 'macports'.  The GUI download .dmg
  file will install a GUI interface but apparently not the command
  line version we need.  If 'which doxygen' gives you an error and
  you believe it is already installed you may need to add the directory
  where the binary was installed to your PATH environment variable.  

- Copy the 3 files in this directory into any model's 'work' directory,
  cd into that directory and run the './gendocs' shell script.  It will 
  generate a single index.html main page plus separate documentation pages 
  for each executable that has a mkmf_xxx and path_names_xxx pair of files 
  in the work directory.  All documentation will be created and put under 
  $DART/doc/doxygen/model_name.

  To create documentation with diagrams of 'used by' and 'uses', run
  './gendocs -devel' to enable the development diagrams.


To use the documentation:

- Open $DART/doc/doxygen/model_name/index.html in a browser and click
  on any executable name.

- Click on the triangle in front of 'Data Types List' to open the list.

- There is a second 'Data Types List'.  Click on that triangle in
  front of the second 'Data Types List' to open the list. You
  should see a list of modules.

- If you click on the text 'Data Types List' instead of the triangle,
  you get a different view of all the modules with the defined data
  types listed.

- Click on one of the modules.  You will then see the reference page
  for that module, with the public types, functions, subroutines,
  and private types, functions, and subroutines.  

- Any text in blue can be clicked on and it will take you to the
  reference page for that type, function or subroutine.
